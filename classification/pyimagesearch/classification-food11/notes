GPU related installations:
    # Install Pytorch
    $ conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
    # Install CUDA (Not required if we run the above command)
    # conda install cuda -c nvidia
    # Check version of cuda

# Training first neural network
1. Defining your neural network architecture
2. Initializing your optimizer and loss function
3. Looping over your number of training epochs
4. Looping over data batches inside each epoch
5. Making predictions and computing the loss on the current batch of data
6. Zeroing out your gradient
7. Performing backpropagation
8. Telling your optimizer to update the gradients of your network
9. Telling PyTorch to train your network with a GPU (if a GPU is available on your machine, of course)
